## What is a Churrasca?

**Churrasca** is a Chilean bread (don't confuse it with [Churrasco][churrasco]!); that is soft and tasty and as the majority of popular Chilean bread, it is super easy to make!, in fact, people in Chile bake Churrasca bread whenever there's a quick event or if the local store
did not have any bread available (this is **BIG** problem for Chilean families!). This bread is perfect to be baked on a grill, in fact, that is the preferred method!.

Enough for the quick intro, the following is what a Churrasca bread looks like ðŸ¤¤ :

## Materials

You're gonna need the following:

* 500gr flour
* 10gr salt
* 65gr shortening
* 300ml warm water

Also make sure you have a big bowl and plastic wrap ðŸ˜‰ .

## Step 1: Integrate the materials by kneading

In a big bowl pour all the materials and start kneading for about 10 minutes.

**Pro Tip**: The water has to be **warm**, not hot, if you can get it from the tap water, 
you can feel the temperature using your fingers.

Once you're done kneading for 10 mins, make a ball with the dough, no worries, it doesn't have to be
perfect. Lastly, wrap the dough with a plastic wrap and let it rest for another 10 minutes.

The dough should look like after 10 mins:

## Step 2: Shaping them up and rest!

Now the fun part begins!, using a knife, carefully cut them in 8 roughly equal 
pieces (maybe Â±100gr each?), knead them a bit and make oval shaped balls, and put 
another plastic wrap over them, and let them rest for 30 minutes.

The dough pieces should look similar to after 30 minutes:

## Final step: Bake them!

This part heavily depends on what you have available, the bread that I showed at the beginning of the page was made using an electric grill, but to get the best results you should use a charcoal grill. But if you
don't have any, the oven works too!.

If using an Oven put the temperature at 210Â°C for about 16-18 mins, be sure to watch the bread in the oven after 16mins has passed, you're looking for a golden color and a mushy look.

Now put some butter on it and enjoy! ðŸ¥–
