## Howdy 👋

Today begins my blogging journey; I'll keep it light, as it is the first post, and I'm still
adding stuff to the site ( and learning multiple stuff! 🤓 ).

My name is **Andres Otarola**, I'm a **Software Developer**, I like **bread baking** and I'm getting myself into **kombucha brewing**.

## But ... Why a Blog?

This is _probably_ my **fourth** attempt at having a personal blog, in my previous attempts my enthusiasm 
lasted until my excitement on the current static page generation engine went away ( sounds familiar? 😜 ). 
So I was motivated but had no goal in mind, and you know, motivation [is an ephemereal thing][ephemereal-motivation]. 

This time I have a clear and simple goal; hone my coding/writing skills by writing at least 
one article a month 💪 .
