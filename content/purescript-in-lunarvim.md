Being a die-hard fan of coding in [`(neo)vim`][neovim], I've been forced myself to look for the perfect (or at the very least _decent_)
configuration of a development environment for my language of choice, or the one I'm currently learning, which in this case is `purescript`.

The present post's goal is to shed some light on certain tooling that exist today but they are probably not
widely known; such as [`LunarVim`][lvim], and also keep a record for myself for _how the hell did I 
configure this!?_ üòú

## What is LunarVim

My main (and pretty much only) editor today is [`LunarVim`][lvim] (for both work and personal stuff), 
the reason I stuck with it instead of my own neovim configuration, is because I like the defaults of the editor and the nice automation it has when adding a new treesitter language or a new lsp implementation.

So if that picked your interest, you should definitely [give it a try!][lvim-install], the cool thing is that it won't
interfere with your current neovim install üòâ.

## Why LSP

For every language that I work I **NEED** to have an implementation of a 
[language server protocol (LSP)][lsp] for it (or similar), I just need to get a feeling of _some standard 
automated process will assist me on my coding_, including simple stuff such as Dockerfile or mardown files
(yes, I want it to be autoformatted for me, that is how lazy I am!)

## How to get it working üíö

### 1. Configure your LunarVim

Make sure you have [installed][lvim-install] `LunarVim`.

[`LunarVim`][lvim] uses [`treesitter`][treesitter] in order to detect file types, and it also includes advanced syntax 
highlighting via the included plugin [`nvim-treesitter`][nvim-treesitter]. But, as of now, it only supports a [fixed set of languages][supported-langs], which does not include `purescript` üò≠

But fear not, you an easily fall back to a super popular plugin, called `vim-polyglot`.

Add the following in your `~/.config/lvim/config.lua`

```
lvim.plugins = {
  -- rest of plugins ...  
  { "sheerun/vim-polyglot" },
  { "purescript-contrib/purescript-vim" },
}
```

Now you have proper file type detection and syntax highlighting!.

### 2. Create a `Purescript` project

The tooling that I use for a `purescript` project are `purescript` (surprise!) and `spago`, so proceed to install then if
you don't have them:

```
$ brew install purescript spago
$ mkdir hello-world-ps
$ cd hello-world-ps
$ spago init
$ spago run
```

Open the created file: 

```
$ lvim src/Main.purs
``` 

`LunarVim` will detect the file type and download the proper `LSP`, in this case is 
[`purescriptls`][pursls] automatically, and... that's it!, really!, enjoy! üòÅ
